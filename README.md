# Knowledge Validator (Agent 2)

This repository will evolve into the Knowledge Validator (KV) service for a multi‑agent knowledge management pipeline. The KV takes structured knowledge extracted by Agent 1 (Knowledge Extractor), checks it for coherence and alignment against reference policies or guidelines, and produces a validation report with issues and clarification questions.

## Project Goals

- Validate extracted knowledge for consistency, contradictions, and obsolescence
- Compare extracted knowledge against reference documents and policies
- Generate a clear validation report and a list of follow‑up questions
- Provide a clean, testable service interface to integrate in a multi‑agent workflow

## Scope (Planned)

- Input: simulated Agent 1 output (structured knowledge objects)
- Input: reference guidelines/policies (documents or structured rules)
- Output: validation report, inconsistencies, and clarification queries

## Status

Early setup phase. This README will expand as implementation starts.
